Entity Component Tree (ECT) is an entity component library designed for the Unity game engine.

Unlike traditional MonoBehaviours, ECT offers an advanced tree-like data structure and effortless multithreading capabilities to improve performance and scalability of game development.
Its modular and flexible architecture makes it an excellent choice for projects of any size or complexity.
